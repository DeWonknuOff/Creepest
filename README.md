__I can run Creepest with other packs?__<br/>
Depends, with the Smithed Launcher, then it likely can, You may have to merge the resourcepack and/or datapack with weld.<br/>

__Im expiencing some render issues__
Optifine tends to make issues with our datapacks, Like flipped or invisible mobs, We are not sure why, because Optifine is closed source.
Theres better Alternatives to Optifine:

__The datapack in server is broken__
Some server or plugin software may cause issues with our datapacks. This notoriously includes Paper, Spigot, Bukkit, Paper and Purpur.
You can try to mess around with the config files, but it's recommended to use Vanilla or Fabric, and sometimes Forge with varying results.<br/><br/>
